/**
 * A reuseable, interruptible task used for loading images on a background thread. The loadImage will immediately
 * interrupt any loading operation already in progress and import data from the given InputStream. Once the image is
 * loaded, the abstract imageLoaded method will be invoked on the event dispatch thread. The cancel method will block
 * until the pending load operation has been terminated, or return immediately if no image is being loaded.
