/**
 * The SearchTask class can be used to implement an incremental search function, realized using a background thread. It
 * will handle all the synchronization necessary for starting and stopping the search properly. Basically, each time you
 * want to update the search token (e.g. the string being searched for), the current search will be interrupted cleanly
 * and a new one will be invoked. Searching will be performed on a background thread, while results will be published on
 * the event dispatch thread for synchronization.
 * <p/>
 * This implementation is reuseable. If you cancel() a search, you can start a new one using the search(T) function at
 * any time.
