This package contain generic event related classes.

<h2>Adapter classes</h2>

Swing offers abstract implementations for some of the more complex listener interfaces, such as MouseListener. For most
event listener interfaces however, no abstract implementation is available even though programmers will usually only use
a single method. This package will contains those abstract classes for all of swing's listener types. In addition to an
empty method implementation, some listeners define an additional method which will be invoked if any kind of event
occurs. For instance, the DocumentAdapter class also provides a method 'documentChanged(DocumentEvent)', which will be
triggered when the document is altered by an insert, update or remove event.

<h2>Core classes</h2>

<h4>EventSupport</h4>

The EventSupport class is a utility for handling listener lists. It is inspired by the PropertyChangeSupport class, but
works for all listener types. In practice, it is a lot simpler to use than the EventListenerList provided by swing.
Rather than writing complex count-down loops and having to check for the listener class, you can make use of a proxy to
implement your fireXXX methods:

<pre>
    private EventSupport&lt;ActionListener&gt; _actionListeners = EventSupport.create(ActionListener.class);
    public void fireActionPerformed(final ActionEvent e) {
        _actionListeners.delegate().actionPerformed(e);
    }
</pre>

Note that due to the fact that EventSupport relies on reflection, it can not be instanciated directly. You have to use
the according factory method to create new instances.

A second implemenation, called WeakEventSupport, mimics the behavior of EventSupport but uses WeakReferences to store
the listener instance. Which implementation you choose is a matter of modelling
style.
