/**
 * A container which puts child components into variable cells. Just as with a JSplitPane, the cell size can be
 * adjusted by dragging the mouse over the cell border. Other than the split pane however, this component does not
 * display visible dividers, but instead relies on the components' border to make the gui less clotted.
 * <p/>
 * The panel will layout its components according to its orientation property, which has to be
 * SwingConstants.HORIZONTAL or SwingConstants.VERTICAL. The cells can be resized along this orientation axis while
 * taking the entire space available for the other axis. Cells can not be made smaller than the wrapped component's
 * minimum size.
 * <p/>
 * You can supply weights along with the components when adding them. If the panel is resized, excess space will be
 * attributed to components according to their weight relative to the total sum of weights, just as its done by
 * the GridBagLayout.
 * <p/>
 * When adding components you should take care of two things: First, make sure that the component has a visible
 * border, for it is going to be the handle used for resizing. Secondly, in order for the gui to behave well when
 * resizing, you should supply a suitable minimum size for components which do not already have one.
