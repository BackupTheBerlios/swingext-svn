/**
 * Keypaths are the central elements employed by the swingext library to get and set properties using reflection. A
 * keypath is created using a list of property names, contatenated in a string and separated by dots. Starting from a
 * given entry point object, the keypath class will try to resolve those properties one by one.
 * <p/>
 * Consider, for instance, a class Person, which exposes two properies: 'age' of type int and 'father' of type Person.
 * Starting from any person instance (let's call him Bob), the keypath "father.father.age" can then be used to set or
 * get this Bob's grandfather's age. Still, the field for Bob's father may not be initialized. Obviously, there is no
 * way to access his grandfather (and therefore retrieve the age property), so the get(Object) method will return null
 * in this case. Trying to set the age for Bob's grandfather will consequently result in an exception to be thrown. You
 * can check in advance if all the properties on the way to the last one are present (read: the keypath can be resolved)
 * by invoking the canResolve(Object) method, passing Bob as the methods argument.
 * <p/>
 * In order to obtain the elements of a keypath, the class will first try to find a bean convention getter or setter,
 * e.g. a public Person getFather() for the 'father' property. If this method can not be found, the keypath will then
 * look for a public field. If this field is not present either, the keypath will then attempt to find a protected,
 * package-local or private method and set it accessible, using the current authentication context. If this fails as
 * well, the keypath will as a last attempt look for a protected, package-local or private field and once again try to
 * make it accessible. If the field is not available either, a MalformedKeyPath exception will be thrown.
 * <p/>
 * A word of caution considering performance: The keypath class will attempt to cache accessors for the different
 * keypath elements to speed up both the get and set method. However, even with caching, resolving a long key path
 * requires several reflection based accessor calls, which are still significantly slower than normal method access. For
 * almost ui-related applications, the keypath implementation should be fast enough, but there are definitely exceptions
 * (for instance when using keypaths to render large tables). Therefore, keypath should be used with a certain caution.
