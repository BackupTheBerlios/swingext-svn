Contains classes used to bind swing components to java beans. This is an internal package. The public portions of the
binding mechanism are available through other packages.

<h2>Core classes</h2>

<h4>SwingBinding</h4>

Base class for bindings between swing components and java beans. Makes use of the keypath concept and adds a proper
thread delegation mechanism.

<h4>Keypath</h4>

The core class of all binding operations. A Keypath represents a line of properties which will be iterated over when
getting or setting properties on the path. This class works analogous to Expression, but offers a more flexible
approach.
