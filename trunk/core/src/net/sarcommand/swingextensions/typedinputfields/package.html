This package contains text components which restrict input to only allow certain character classes or patterns. Those
fields are usually associated with a value type, like a date or a number, and provide according getter methods to
retrieve the value as an instance of this type. The most simple example for this class of
widgets is the IntegerInputField. It restricts user input to digits and the '-' character. Letters or special characters
can not be entered.

<h2>Core Classes</h2>

<h4>IntegerInputField and DoubleInputField</h4>
These implementations will only allow the user to enter a number of the according type, and automatically convert the
text value into instances of Integer or Double.

<h4>RegexpConstrainedDocument</h4>
This class can be used to create a TypedInputField based on a regular expression. You can, for instance, easily create
an instance which will only accept valid email addresses.

<h4>TypedInputFieldEditCallback</h4>
When an input field is being edited, the user may enter characters which can not be used to represent the field's value
type, or he may enter valid characters which do not make a valid value in their current order. This interface declares
callback methods used by an input field in order to give a visual response to the user, such as painting the field red
or beeping.
