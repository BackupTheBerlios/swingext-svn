/**
 * The ActionManager class is a utility meant to help you handle the javax.swing.Action instances within your
 * application. It combines the following three major functions:
 * <p/>
 * <li> Creation and management of singleton instances for each Action, organized by identifiers.</li> <li> Handling
 * action execution by implementing a responder chain mechanism</li>
 * <p/>
 * <h3> Creating and managing actions</h3>
 * <p/>
 * Actions are managed using a unique identifier. Any object can be used as an identifier, but it is strongly
 * recommended that you create an enumeration for the actions within your application since is makes development a lot
 * easier. You can request a singleton instance of the Action for an identifier by using the getAction method. The
 * ActionManager keeps track of the Actions which already have been created, so no two instances will exist for the same
 * identifier.
 * <p/>
 * If the requested action does not exist yet, the ActionProvider will be invoked to create it. An ActionProvider is
 * basically a pluggable factory which can be set using the setActionProvider method. Setting an appropriate
 * ActionProvider when initializing your application is pretty much the only thing you have to do in order to get the
 * ActionManager up and running. Several ActionProvider instances exist which should cover most of the required
 * functions.
 * <p/>
 * <h3>Handling action execution</h3>
 * <p/>
 * The ActionManager will (in most cases) handle execution of actions using a responder chain pattern. A responder chain
 * is basically a hierarchical list of entities which might be able to handle a given action. Triggered actions will
 * move along this list until a suitable handler has been found. In order to do so, Responder candidates have to
 * implement the ActionHandler interface.
 * <p/>
 * The root of the responder chain will be determined by distinguishing between component actions (like those installed
 * in generic control buttons) and focus actions, which may originate in a control but really target the currently
 * focused one. A component action's responder chain will be identical to the trigger control's component hierarchy,
 * while a focus action's responder chain originates in the element which currently posesses the keyboard focus. A
 * simple example for a focus action is the copy command. If you installed the copy action to the menu bar and attached
 * an accelerator key, you will want to copy the current selection when pressing ctrl+c (unless of course if you're
 * using a mac). The ActionManager will identify this action as a focus action (see below) and start looking for
 * responders with the currently focused element. For instance, you might have been typing in a text field. The first
 * possible responder will therefore be the text field itself. If the text field can't handle the action, its parent
 * component will be asked to do so, then the parent's parent, and so on until a responder has been found.
 * <p/>
 * The ActionHandler will distinguish between normal actions and focus actions by looking at the action's
 * RESPONDER_CHAIN_ROOT property. This property can take two values, 'component' or 'focus'. If the property has not
 * been set, the ActionManager will assume that the action is a focus action since this should apply in the majority of
 * cases.
