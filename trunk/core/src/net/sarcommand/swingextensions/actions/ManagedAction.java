/**
 * A ManagedAction is a utility class used by the ActionManager to handle responder chain actions. Basically,
 * ManagedAction extends a normal AbstractAction by adding an identifier to each action and by supplying an
 * implementation for actionPerformed(ActionEvent). This default implementation will simply notify the ActionManager
 * that the action has been triggered and leave the actual execution to it.
