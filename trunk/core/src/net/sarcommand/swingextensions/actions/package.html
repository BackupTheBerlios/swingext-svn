This package contains utility class for creating and managing actions. It offers different action implementations,
based on Reflection or a responder chain concept and means to create localized actions using resource bundles.

<h2>Core classes</h2>

<h4>ActionManager</h4>

The ActionManager is a static utility class handling the lifecycle of Action instances. It uses an ActionProvider to
create Actions, caches their instances while the application is active and follows responder chains when an action is
executed. See the class documentation for further information on the responder chain concept.

<h4>ActionProvider</h4>

An ActionProvider realizes the factory pattern in order to instanciate Actions. Actions can be created from external
representations, e.g. the ResourceBundleActionProvider will use the standard properties localization concept.

<h4>ActionHandler</h4>

A callback interface used by the ActionManager to find a suitable responder for an action. See the documentation for the
ActionManager class for information on the responder chain concept.
