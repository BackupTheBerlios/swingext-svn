/**
 * Default implementation for a JSelectionTree's renderer. This implementation will simply add suitable
 * checkbox icons in front of each node where applicable.
 * <p/>
 * If you want to change the icons being used, you can either use the getter/setter methods or globally define
 * your own icons by providing a custom ResourceBundle for the swingextensions package.
