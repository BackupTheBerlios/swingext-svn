\f0\fs24 \cf0 One issues that is not handled too well in vanilla swing is the handling of file chooser accessories. The JFileChooser class will allow you to install a single accessory, but you won't have any way of saying where the accessory should appear (this is platform specific). Imagine you want to provide a preview for the file's content. If you want to preview images, it makes sense to display a thumbnail left or right of the file selection pane. If the file is text or csv, you'll probably want it to appear below the pane, as you would with file-specific settings. Maybe you would want to have both accessories visible at the same time, as for instance Photoshop does.\

You can do so using the SimpleAccessoryManager class, which is attached to a JFileChooser (rather than subclassing it for flexibility reasons). When attached, you can set arbitrary components to be accessories in the positions north, south, west and east.}
