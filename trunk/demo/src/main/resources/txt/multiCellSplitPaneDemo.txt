It is difficult to predict optimal component sizes when layouting a UI. Depending on factors such as screen resolution or used LookAndFeel, but also on the use case an application is being employed for, the optimal distribution of space may vary. The JSplitPane class helps a little by allowing a somewhat dynamic layout, but is limited to 2 components. The MultiCellSplitPane implementation essentially follows the same approach, but allows for an arbitrary number of resizable cells. You can also combine multiple MultiCellSplitPane instances to create a resizeable grid.
